1. create a type SQUARE
    - length float64
    - width float64
 
2. createatypeCIRCLE
    - radiusfloat64
3. attach a method to each that calculates AREA and returns it
    - circle area = πr2
        * math.Pi
        * math.Pow
    - squarearea=L*W
4. create a type SHAPE that defines an interface as anything that has the AREA method
5. create a func INFO which takes type shape and then prints the area
6. create a value of type square
7. create a value of type circle
8. use func info to print the area of square
9. use func info to print the area of circle
